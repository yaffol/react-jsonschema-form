# Crossref Form-Runner Prototype

This repo forms the basis for the Proof of Concept demonstration of the new Deposit UI framework.

It is based on [React JSONSchema Form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) which was originally sponsored by Mozilla.

To run the demo, execute `./run.sh` in the root of the project.
This will build a docker container which will compile and serve the form-runner. 

When it's finished the build process, you can access the form at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) - it will open a browser at `http:0.0.0.0:8080` automatically but this will not work
