# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - deploy-pages

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  image: registry.gitlab.com/crossref/infrastructure/aws-ecr-ecs-cicd-docker:latest
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - ./run.sh public
    - echo "Compile complete."
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public # artifact path must be /public for GitLab Pages to pick it up

unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"

lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No lint issues found."
    
pages: # the job must be named pages
  image: node:lts-alpine
  stage: deploy-pages
  script:
    # optionally, you can activate gzip support wih the following line:
    - find public -type f -regex '.*\.\(htm\|html\|txt\|text\|js\|css\)$' -exec gzip -f -k {} \;
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public # artifact path must be /public for GitLab Pages to pick it up


deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
